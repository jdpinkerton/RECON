Helleſpont guilty of true loues blood,
In view and oppoſit two Cities ſtood,
Seaborders,diſioin'd by Neptunes might,
The one Abydos, the other Seſtos hight.
At Seſtos Hero dwelt, Hero the faire,
Whom young Apollo courted for her haire,
And offered as a dower his burning throne,
Where ſhe ſhould ſit for men to gaze vpon.
The outſide of her garments were of lawne,
The lining,purple ſilke, with guilt ſtarres drawne,
Her wide ſleeues greene, and bordered with a groue,
Where Venus in her naked glory ſtroue,
To pleaſe the careleſſe and diſdainfull eyes
Of proud Adonis that before her lyes :
Her kirtle blue, whereon was many a ſtaine,
Made with the bloud of wretched louers ſlaine.

Vpon her head ſhe ware a myrtle wreath,
From whence her vaile reacht to the groud beneath.
Her vaile was artificiall flowers and leaues,
Whoſe workmanſhip both man and beaſt deceiues.
Many would praiſe the ſweet ſmell as ſhe paſt,
When' twas the odour which her breath forth caſt.
And there for hony,Bees haue ſought in vaine,
And beat from thence, haue lighted there againe.
About her necke hung chaines of peble ſtone,
Which lightned by her necke, like Diamons ſhone.
She ware no gloues, for neither ſunne nor wind,
Would burne or parch her hands, but to her mind,
Or warme or coole them, for they tooke delite,
To play vpon thoſe hands, they wereſo white ;
Buskins of ſhels, all ſiluered vſed ſhe,
And brancht with bluſhing Corall to the knee,
Where Sparrowes pearcht, of hollow pearle & gold,
Such as the world would wonder to behold :
Thoſe with ſweet water oft her handmayd fils,
Which as ſhe went would cherup through the bils.
Some ſay for her the faireſt Cupid pin'd;
And looking in her face was ſtrucken blind,
But this is true, ſo like was one the other,
As he imagin'd Hero was her mother,
And oftentimes into her boſome flew,
About her naked necke his bare armes threw,
And laid his childiſh head vpon her breſt,

And with ſtill panting rocke, there tooke his reſt.
So louely faire was Hero, Venus Nun,
As Nature wept, thinking ſhe was vndone,
Becauſe ſhe too ke more from her then ſhe left,
And of ſuch wondrous beauty her bereft ;
Therefore in ſigne her treaſure ſuffred wracke,
Since Heroes time, hath halfe the world been blacke.
A morous Leander, beautifull and young,
(Whoſe tragedy diuine Muſaeus ſung)
D welt at Abydus, ſince him dwelt there none,
For whom, ſucceeding times may greater mone.
His dandling treſſes that were neuer ſhorne,
Had they been cut, and vnto Colchos borne,
Would haue allur'd the ventrous youth of Greece,
To hazard more then for the golden fleece.
Faire Cynthia wiſht his armes might be her ſphere ,
Griefe makes her pale becauſe ſhe moues not there.
His body was as ſtraight as Circes wand,
Ioue might haue ſipt out Nectar from his hand:
Euen as delicious meat is to the taſte,
So was his necke in touching, and ſurpaſt
The white of Pelops ſhoulder, I could tell yee,
How ſmooth his breſt was, and how white his belly,
And whoſe immortall fingers did imprint
That heauenly path, with many a curious dint,
That runs along his backe; but my rude pen
Can hardly blazon forth the loues of men.

Much lefſe of powerfull gods, let it ſuffice,
That my ſlacke Muſe muſt ſing of Leanders eyes.
Theſe orient cheeks and lips, exceeding his
That leapt into the water for a kiſſe
Of his owne ſhadow, and deſpiſing many,
Dyed ere he could enioy the loue of any.
Had wilde Hippolitus Leander ſeene,
Enamored of his beauty had he beene,
His preſence made the rudeſt paiſant melt,
That in the vaſt vplandiſh country dwelt,
The barbarous Thracian ſouldier mou'd with nought
Was mou'd with him, and for his fauour ſought.
Some ſwore he was a mayd in mans attire,
For in his lookes were all that men deſire,
A pleaſant ſmiling cheeke, a ſpeaking eye,
A brow for Loue to banquet royally,
And ſuch as knew he was a man, would ſay,
Leander, thou art made for amorous play,
Why art thou not in Loue, and lou'd of all ?
Though thou be faire,yet be not thine owne thrall.
The men of wealthy Seſtos euery yeere,
For his ſake whom their Goddeſſe held ſo deare,
Roſe-cheekt Adonis kept a ſolemne feaſt,
Thither reſorted many a wandred gueſt,
To meet their loues, ſuch as had none at all,
Came Louers home from this great feſtiuall.
For euery ſtreet like to a Firmament,

Gliſtered with breathing ſtars, who,where they went
Frighted the Melancholy earth, which deem'd,
Hternall heauen to burne, for ſo it ſeem'd,
As if anotlier Phaeton had got
The guidance of the ſunnes rich chariot.
But farre aboue the louelieſt Hero ſhin'd,
And ſtole away th'inchanted gazers mind:
For like Sea nimphs inueigling harmony.
So was her beanty to the ſtanders by.
Nor that night wandring pale and watry ſtarre,
(When yawning Dragons draw her thirlingcarre,
From Latmus mount vp to the gloomy skie,
Where crown'd with blazing light and maieſtie
She proudly ſits,) more ouer-rules the flood,
Than ſhe the hearts of thoſe that neere her ſtood.
Euen as, when gawdy Nimphes purſue the chaſe,
Wretched Icions ſhaggy-footed race,
Incenſt with ſauage heate,gallop amaine,
From ſteepe Pine bearing mountaines to the plaine :
So ran the people forta to gaze vpon her,
And all that view'd her, were enamour'd on her.
And as in fury of a dreadfull fight,
Their fellowes being ſlaine, or put to flight,
Poore ſoldiers ſtand with feare of death dead ſtrooke,
So at her preſence all ſurprizde and tooken,
Awayt the ſentence of her ſcornefull eyes :
He whom ſhe fauours liues, the other dyes.

There might you ſee one ſigh, another rage,
And ſome (their violent paſsions to aſſwage,
Compile ſharpe Satyrs, but alas too late,
For faithfull oue will neuer turne to hate,
And many ſeeing great Princes were denyed,
Pin'd as they went,and thinking on her,dyed.
On this feaſt day, o curſed day and hower,
Went Hero thoro w Seſtos, from her tower
To Venus temple, where vnhappily,
As after chanc'd, they did each other ſpy,
So faire a Church as this had Venus none,
The wals were of diſcoloured Iaſper ſtone,
Wherein was Proteus caru'd, and ouer head
A liuely vine of greene ſea agget ſpread,
Where by one hand light-headed Bacchus hung,
And with the other, wine from grapes out-wrung.
Of Cryſtall ſhining faire, the pauement was,
The towne of Seſtos, call'd it Venus glaſſe :
There might you ſee the gods in ſundry ſhapes,
Com mitting headdy ryots, inceſt,rapes,
For kno w, that vnderneath this radiant flower
Was Danaes ſtatue in a brazen tower,
Ioue ſlily ſtealing from his ſiſters bed,
To dally with Idalian Ganimed;
And for his loue Europa bellowing lowd,
And tumbling with the Rain-bow in a cloud :
Bloud-quaffing Mars heauing the yron net,

Which limping Vulcan and his Cyclops ſet :
Loue kindling fire, to burne ſuch townes as Troy,
Siluanus weeping for the louely boy,
That now is turn'd into a Cypres tree,
Vnder whoſe ſhade the Wood-gods loue to be.
And in the midſt a ſiluer altar ſtood,
There Hero ſacrificing Turtles blood,
Tayl'd to the ground, vailing her eye-lids cloſe,
And modeſtly they ope as ſheroſe.
Thence flew Loues ? he golden head,
And thus Leander was moured.
Stone-ſtill he ſtood, and e iermore he gazed,
Till with the fire that fro n his countenance blazed,
Relenting Hero's gentle heart was ſtrooke,
Such force and vertue hath an amorous looke.
It lies not in our power to loue or hate,
For will in vs is ouer-rul'd by Fate :
When two are ſtript long ere the courſe begin,
We wiſh that one ſhould loſe, the other winne.
And one eſpecially do we affect,
Of two gold Ingots like in each reſpect,
The reaſon no man knowes, let it ſuffice,
What we behold is cenſur'd by our eyes.
Where both delibrat, the loue is ſlight.
Who euer lou'd, that lou'd not at firſt ſight:
He kneel'd, but vnto her deuoutly prayd :
Chaſt Hero, to her ſelfe thus ſoftly ſayd ;

Were I the Saint he worſhips, I would heare him :
And as ſhe ſpake thoſe words, came ſomewhat neere
(him. He ſtarted vp, ſhe bluſht as one aſhan'd,
Where with Leander much more was inflam'd.
He toucht her hand, in touching it ſhe trembled,
Loue deopely grounded, haroly is d ſſembled.
Theſe louers parled by the touch of hands.
True loue is mute and oft amazed ſtands.
Thus while dumb ſigns their yielding harts entagled,
He ayre with ſpar kles of liuing fire was ſpangled,
And night eepe drencht in miſty Acheron,
HeaV'd vp her head, and halfe the world vpon,
eath'd darkneſſe forth ( darke night is (npids day,
And now begins Leender to diſplay
Loues holy fire, with words, with ſighes, and teare
hch like ſweet muſicke entred Heroes eares :
And yet at euery word he turn'd aſide,
dwes cut himn of as he replide.
At laſt  he to a bold harpe Sophiſter,
Wih cheareſull hope ths he accoſted her.
Faire creature, let me ſpeake without offence,
would my rude words had the influence,
To lead thy thoughts as thy faire lookes do mine,
Then ſhouldſt thou be Lis Priſoner who is thine.
Te not vnkind and faire: miſhapen ſtuffe
Are of behauiours boiſterous and ruffe.
O ſhun me not, but heare me ere you goe,

God kno wes I cannot force loue as you doe.
My words ſhall be as ſpotleſſe as my youth,
Full of ſimplicity and naked truth.
This ſacrifice (whoſe ſweet perfume deſcending,
From Venns altar to your footſteps bending)
Doth teſtilie that you exceed her farre,
To whom you offer, and whoſe Nunne you are.
Why ſhould you worſhip her? her yon ſorpaſſe,
As much as ſparkling Diamonds flaring glaſſe.
A Diamond ſet in lead,his worth retaines,
A heauenly Nymph belov'd of humane ſwames,
Receines no blemith, but oft-times more grace,
Which makes me hope althongh I am but baſe,
Baſe in reſpect of thee, diume and pure,
Dutifull ſeruice may thy loue procure,
And in duety will excell allother,
As thou in beauty doeſt exceed loues mother.
Nor heauen nor thou were made to gaze vpon :
As heauen preſerues all things, ſo ſaue thou one.
A ſtately oui ded ſhip, wel rigo'd and tall,
The Ocean maketh more maieſticall :
Why veweſt thou then to liue in Seſtos here,
Who on Loues ſeas more glorious wouldſt anpeare ?
Like vntun'd golden ſtrings all women are,
Which long time lye vntouch't will harſbly iarre.
Veſſels of braſſe oft handled, brightly ſhine,
What difference betwixt the richeſt Mine,

And baſeſt mold, but vſe ? for both not vſ'd,
Are of like worth. Then treaſure is abuſ'd,
When Miſers keepe it, being put to lone,
In time it will returne vs two for one.
Rich robes, them ſelues and others do adorne,
Neither themſelues nor others, if not worne.
Who builds a Palace,and rams vp the gate,
Shall ſee it ruinous and deſolate.
Ah ſimple Hero, learne thy ſelfe to cheriſh.
Lone women like to empty houſes periſh ;
Leſſe ſins the poore-rich man that ſtarues himſelfe,
In heaping vp a maſſe of droſsy pelfe,
Than ſuch as you, his golden earth remaines,
Which aſter his deceaſe ſome other gaines.
But this faire gem ſweet, in the loſſe alone,
When you fleet hence, can be bequeath'd to none,
Or if it could, downe from th'enameld skie,
Al heauen would come to claime this legacie,
And with inteſtine broy les the world deſtroy,
And quite confound natures ſweet harmony.
Well therefore by the gods decreed it is,
We humane creatures ſhould enioy that blis;
One is no number, mayds are nothing then,
Without the ſweet ſociety of men.
WIt thon liue ſingle ſtill? one ſhalt thou be,
Thogh neuer-ſingling Hymen couple thee.
auages, that drinke of running ſprings,

Thinke water farre excels all earthly things,
But they that daily taſte neate wine,deſpile it,
Virginity, albeit ſome highly priſe it,
Compar'd with mariage, had you try'd them both,
Differs as much, as wine and water doth.
Baſe boullion for the ſtam pes ſake we allow,
Euen ſo for mens impreſsion do we you,
By which alone, our reuerend fathers ſay,
Women receiue perlection euery way.
This Idoll which you tearme Virginity
Is neither eſſence ſubiect to the eye,
No, nor to any one exterior ſence,
Nor hath it any place of reſidence.
Nor is 't of earth or molde celeſtiall,
Or capable of any forme at all.
Of that which hath no being do not boaſt,
Things that are not at all are neuer loſt.
Men ſooliſhly do call it vertuous,
What vertue is it, that is borne with vs,
Much leſſe can honour be aſcrib'd thereto,
Honour is purchas'd by the deeds we doe,
Beleeue me Hero, honour is not wonne,
Vntill ſome honourable deed be done.
Seeke you for chaſtity, immortall fame,
And know that ſome haue wrong'd Dianas name,
Whoſe name is it, if ſhe befalſe or not,
So ſhe be faire, but ſome vile tongues will blot ?

But you are ſaire (iye me) ſo wondrous faire,
entle, and ſo debonaire,
ke, thus you hue alone,
eone or othen Feepes you as his owne,
hen Io, hate me not, nor from me flie,
tlyamie :
ycred Prieſthood makes thee loath :
T  whom mad'ſt thou that heedleſſe oatht
O  wered ſhe,and as ſhe ſpake,
rom thoſe two tralucent ceſternes brake
eame of liquid pearle, which downe her face
he paths,wheron the gods might trace
Court. He thus replide : the rites
Loues beauteous Empreſſe moſt delites,
ets, Doricke muſicke, midnight reuell,
, and all that ſterne age counteth euill,
ot doth ſhee ſcorne,
vowin chaſſity, haſt ſworne,
O   er name and honour, and thereby
ine farre worle than periury:
edged ainſt her Deity,
rand formall purity.
ih ſin, kiſſe, and ſhake hands,
es this Venus demands.
e ſhe ſmil'd, and did deny him ſo,
ere ht he hope for moe,
makes him quickly re-enforce his ſpeech,

And her in humble manner thus beſeech.
Though neither gods nor men may thee deſerue,
Yet for her ſake whom you haue vow'd to ſerue,
Aband on fruitleſſe cold Virginity,
The gentle Queene of Loues ſole enemy,
Then ſhall you moſt reſemble Venus Nun,
When Venus ſweet rites are perform'd and dun,
Flint-breſted Pallas ioyes in ſingle life,
But Pallas and your Miſtris are at ſtrife.
Loue Hero then, and be not tyrannous,
But heale the heart that thou haſt wounded thus,
Nor ſtaine thy youthfull yeares with auarice,
Faire fooles delight to be accounted nice.
The richeſt corne dyes, if it be not reapt,
Beauty alone is loſt, too warily kept.
Theſe arguments he vſ'd, and many more,
Wherewith ſhee yeelded, that was wonne before,
H roes lookes yeelded, but her words made warre,
Women are won when they begin to iarre.
Thus hauing ſwallo wed Cupils golden hooke,
The more ſhe ſtriu'd, the deeper was ſhe ſtrooke.
Yet euilly faining anger, ſtroue ſhe ſtill,
And would be thought to graut againſt her will :
So hauing paus'd a while, at laſt ſhe ſayd,
Who taught thee Rethorike to deceiue a mayd ?
Aye me,ſuch words as theſe ſhould I abhor,
And yet I like them for the Orator.

With that Leander ſtoopt to haue imbrac'd her,
But from his ſpreading armes away ſhe caſt her,
And thus beſpake him : Gentle youth forbeare
To touch the ſacred garments which I weare.
Vpon a rocke, and vnderneath a hill,
Farre from the towne (where all is whiſt and ſtill,
Saue that the Sea playing on yellow ſand,
Sends forth a ratling murmure to the land,
Whoſe ſound allures the golden Morpheus,
In ſilence of the night to viſite vs
My turret ſtands, and there god knowes I play,
With Venus ſwannes, and ſparrowes all the day,
A' dwarfiſh beldam beares me company,
That hops about the chamber where I lye ;
And ſpends the night (that might be better ſpent)
In vaine diſcourſe and apiſh merriment,
Come thither : As ſhe ſpake this, her tongue tript,
For vnawares (Come thither ) from her ſlipt,
And ſodainely her former colour chang'd,
And here and there her eyes through anger rang'd,
And like a planet mouing ſeuerall wayes,
At one ſelfe inſtant, ſhe poore ſoule aſſayes,
Louing, not to loue at all, and euery part :
Stroue to reſiſt the motions of her heart,
And hands ſo pure, ſo innocent, nay ſuch
As might haue made heauen ſtoope to haue a touch,
Did ſhe vphold to Venus, and againe,

Vow'd ſpotleſſe chaſtity, but all in vaine,
Cupid beats downe her prayers with his wings,
Her vowes aboue the empty ayre he flings,
All deepe enrag'd, his ſinowy bow he bent,
And ſhot a ſhaft, that burning from him went,
Wherewith ſhe ſtrooken lookt ſo dolefully
As made Loue ſigh, to ſee his tyranny.
And as ſhe wept, her teares to pearle he turn'd,
And wound them on his arme,and for her mourn'd,
Then towards the Palace of the Deſtinies,
Laden with languiſhment, and griefe he flies,
And to thoſe ſterne Nymphs,humbly made requeſt,
Both might enioy each other, and be bleſt,
But with a ghaſtly, dreadfull countenance,
Threatning a thouſand deaths at euery glance,
They anſwered Loue, nor would vouchſafe ſo much
As one poore word, their hate to him was ſuch ;
Hearken a while, and I will tell you why,
Heauens winged herrald, loue-borne Mercurie,
The ſelfe ſame day that he aſſeepe had laid
Inchanted Argus ſpied a country maid,
Whoſe careleſſe haire,in ſtead of pearle t'adorne it,
Gliſtred wirh dew, as one that ſeem'd to ſcorne it,
Her breath as fragrant as the morning roſe,
Her mind pure, and her tongue vntaught to gloſe.
Yet proud ſhe was, (for lofty pride that dwels,
In towred Courts, is oft in ſhepheards cels.)

And too too well the faire vermilion knew,
And ſiluer tinctture of her cheeks, that drew
The loue of euery Swaine : On her this god
Enamoured was, and with his Snaky rod,
Did charme her nimble feet, and made her ſtay,
The while vpon the hillocke downe he lay,
And ſweetly on his pipe began to play,
And with ſmooth ſpeech her rancy to aſſay,
Till in his twining armes he lockt her faſt;
And then he woo'd with kiſſes, and at laſt,
As Shepheards doe, her on the ground he laid,
And tumbling in the graſſe, he often ſtraid
Beyond the bounds of ſhame, in being bold
To eye thoſe parts which no eye ſhould behold,
And like an inſolent commanding louer,
Boaſting his parentage, would needs diſcouer
The way to ne w Eliſium : but ſhe,
Whoſe onely dower was her chaſtity,
Hauing ſtriv n'in vaine, was now about to crie,
And craue the helpe of Shepheards that were nie.
Herewith he ſtayd his fury and began
To giue her leaue to riſe, aw ay ſhe ran,
After went Mercury, who vſ'd ſuch cunning,
As ſhe to heare his tale, left off her running.
Maids are not wonne by brutiſh force and might,
But ſpeeches full of pleaſure and delight,
And knowing Hermes courted her, was glad

That ſhe ſuch louelineſſe and beauty had,
As could prouoke his liking, yet was mute,
And neither would deny nor grant his ſute.
Still vow'd he loue,ſhe wanting no excuſe,
To feed him with delayes as women vſe,
Or thirſting after immortality,
All women are ambitious naturally,
Impoſ'd vpon her louer ſuch a taske,
As he ought not performe, nor yet ſhe aske,
A draught of flowing Nectar ſhe requeſted,
Wherewith the king of gods and men is feaſted.
He ready to accompliſh what ſhe wild,
Stole ſome from Hebe ( Hebe loues cup fild ,)
And gaue it to his ſimple ruſtike loue,
Which being knowne(as what is hid from loue?)
He inly ſtorm'd, and waxt more furious,
Than for the fire filcht by Promethius,(here,
And thruſts him downe from heauen, he wandring
In mournfull tearmes, with ſad and heauy cheare,
Complain'd to Cupid, Cupid for his ſake,
To be reueng'd on Ioue,did vndertake,
And thoſe on whom heauen, earth,and hell relies,
I meane the adamantine Deſtinies,
He wounds with loue, and forſt them equally,
To dote vpon deceitſull Mercurie,
They ofre ehi the deadly fatali kniſe,
That ſheares the ſlende thr'd, of hanelile,

At this faire feathered feet, the engins laid,
Which th'earth from ougly (haos den vp-waid,
Theſe he regarded not, but did entreat
That loue, Vſurper of his fathers ſeat,
Might preſently be baniſht into hell,
And aged Saturne in Olimpus'd well.
They granted what he crau'd, and once againe,
Saturne and Ops began their golden raigne.
Murder, rape, warre, luſt and trechery,
Were with loue clos'd in Stigian Emperie.
But long this bleſſed time continued not,
As ſoone as he his wiſhed purpoſe got,
He rechleſſe of his promiſe, did deſpiſe
The loue of th'euerlaſting deſtinies.
They ſeeing it, both Loue and him abhor'd,
And Iupiter vnto his place reſtor'd.
And but that learning in deſpight of Fate,
Will mount aloft, and enter heauen gato,
And to the ſeat of Ioue it ſelfe aduance,
Herwes had ſlept in hell with ignorance.
Yet as a puniſhment they added this,
That he and pouerty ſhould alwaies kiſſe :
And to this day is euery Scholler poore,
Groſſe gold from them runs headlong to the Boore,
Likewiſe, the angry ſiſters thus deluded,
To venige themſelues on Hermes haue concluded,
That Midas brood ſhall ſit in honors chaire,

To which the Muſes ſonnes are onely heire,
And fruitfull wits that in aſpiring are,
Shall diſcontent run into regions farre,
And few great Lord in vertuous deeds ſhall ioy,
But be ſurpriz'd with euery gariſh toy,
And ſtill inrich the lofty ſeruile Clowne,
Who with incroching guile, keepes learning downe.
Then muſe not Cupids ſuit no betcer ſped,
Seeing in their loues the Fates were iniured.

Y this ſad Hero with loue vnacquainted,
Viewing Leanders face, fell downe and fainted :
He kiſt her, and breath'd life into her lips,

Wherewith as one diſpleas'd, away ſhee trips,
Yet as ſhe went full often lookt behind,
And many poore excuſes did ſhee find
To linger by the way, and once ſhee ſtayd,
And would haue turn'd againe, but was afrayd,
In offering parly, to be counted light.
So on ſhe goes, and in her idle flight,
Her painted fanne of curled plumes let fall,
Thinking to traine Leander therewithall.
He being a Nouice knew not what ſhe meant
But ſtayd, and after her a letter ſent :
Which ioyfull Hro anſwered in ſuch ſort,
As he had hope to ſcale the beauteous fort,
Wherein the liberall Graces lockt their wealth ;
And therefore to her tower he got by ſtealth.
Wide open ſtood the dore, he need not clime;
And ſhee her ſelfe before the pointed time,
Had ſpred the boord, with roſes ſtrowed the roome,
And oft looked out, and mus'd he did not come
At laſt he came : O who can tell the greeting,
Theſe greedy louers had at their firſt meeting :
He askt, ſhe gaue, and nothing was denyed,
Both to each ot 'er quickly were affyed.
Looke how their hands , ſo were their hearts vnited ;
And what he did, ſhe willingly requited.
(Sweet are the kiſſes, the imbracements ſweet,
When like deſires and affections meet.

For from the earth to heauen, is Cupid rais'd,
Where fancy is in equall ballance pais'd)
Yet ſhe this raſhnes ſodainely repented,
And turn'd aſide, and to her ſelfe lamented ;
As if her name and honour had been wrong,
By being poſſeſt of him for whom ſhe long
I, and ſhe wiſht, albeit not from her heart,
That he would leaue her turret and depart.
The mirthfull god of amorous pleaſure ſmil'd,
To ſee how he this captiue Nimph beguil' d ;
For hitherto he did but fan the fire,
And kept it downe that it might mount the hier.
Now waxt ſhe iealous, leſt his loue abated,
Fearing her owne thoughts , made her to be hated ;
Therefore vnto him haſtily ſhe goes,
And like light Salmacis her body throes
Vpon his boſome, where with yeelding eyes,
She offers vp her ſelfe a ſacrifice,
To ſlake his anger,if he were diſpleaſ'd ;
O what god would not therewith be appeas'd ?
Like Aeſops Cocke, this iewell he enioyed,
And as a brother with his ſiſter toyed,
Suppoſing nothing els was to be done,
Now he her fauour and good will had wonne ;
But know ye not that creatures wanting ſence,
By nature haue a mutuall appetence,
And wanting organs to aduance a ſtep,

Mou'd by Loues force, vnto each other lep,
Much more in ſubiects hauing intellect,
Some hidden influence breeds like effect,
Albeit Leander rude in loue,and raw,
Long dallying with Hero nothing ſaw,
hat might delight him more, yet he ſuſpected
Some amorous rites or other were neglected :
Therefore vnto his body,hers he clung,
(ued, She, fearing on the ruſhes to be flung,
Striy'd with redoubled ſtrength, the more ſhe ſtri¬
The more a gentle pleaſing heat reuiued,
Which taught him all that elder louers know ;
And now the ſame gan ſo to ſcorch and glow,
As in plaine termes (yet cunningly) he crau'd it ;
Loue alwaies makes thoſe eloquent that haue it :
She, with a kind of granting, put him by it,
And euer as he thought himſeile moſt nigh it,
Like to the tree of Tantalus ſhe fled,
And ſeeming lauiſh, ſau'd her mayden-head:
Ne re Sing more ſought to keepe his Diademe,
Than Hero this ineſtimable gem me.
A boue our life we loue a ſtedfaſt friend,
Yet when a token of great worth we ſend,
We often kiſſe it, often looke thereon,
And ſtay the meſſenger that would be gone :
o maruell then, though Hero would not yeeld
ſoone to part from that ſhe dearely held.

Iewels been loſt are found againe, this neuer,
Tis loſt but once, and once loſt,loſt for euer.
Now had the morne eſpy'd her louers ſteeds,
Whereat ſhe ſtarts, puts on her purple weeds,
And red for anger that he ſtayd ſo long,
All headlong throwes her ſelfe the clouds among,
And now Leander fearing to be miſt,
Imbrac't her ſodainly, tooke leaue and kiſt :
Long was he taking leaue and loth to goe,
And kiſt againe as louers vſe to doe :
Sad Hero wrung him by the hand and wept,
Saying; Let your vowes and promiſes be kept.
Then ſtanding at the dore, ſhe turn'd about,
As loth to ſee Leander going out.
And now the ſunne that through th'orizon peepes,
As pittying theſe Louers, downward creepes.
So that in ſilence of the clowdy night,
Though it was morning did he take his flight :
But what the ſecret truſty night conceal'd,
Leanders amorous habite ſoone reueal'd,
With Cupids myrtle was his bonnet crownd,
Ab out his armes the purple riband wound,
Wherwith ſhe wreath'd her largely ſpreading heare,
Nor co uld the youth abſtaine, but he muſt weare
The ſacred ring wherewith ſhe was endow'd,
When firſt religious chaſtity ſhe vow'd,
Which made his loue through Seſtos to be knowne,

And thence vnto Abydus ſooner blowne,
Than he could ſayle, for incorporeall Fame,
Whoſe weight conſiſts in nothing but her name,
Is ſwifter than the wind, whoſe tardy plumes
Are reeking water, and dull earthly fumes.
Home when he came, he ſeem'd not to be there,
But like exiled ayre thruſt from his ſphere,
Set in a forren place, and ſtraight from thence,
Alcides like by mighty violence,
He would haue chac'd away the ſwelling Maine
That him from her vniuſtly did detaine :
Like as the Sunne in a Diameter,
Fires and inflames obiects remooued farre,
And heateth kindly ſhining lat'rally,
So beauty ſweetly quickens when it s nie ;
But being ſeparated and remoued,
Burnes where it cheriſht, murders where it loued :
Therefore, euen as an Index to a boo ke,
So to his mind was young Leanders looke;
O none haue power but gods their loue to hide,
Affection by the count'nance is deſcride.
The light of hidden fire it ſelfe diſcouers,
And loue that is conceal'd, betraies poore louers.
His ſecret flame apparantly was ſeene,
Leanders father knew where he had beene,
And for the ſame mildly rebuk'd his ſonne,
Thinking to quench the ſparkles new begunne.

But loue reſiſted once growes paſsionate,
And nothing more then counſell louers hate :
For, as a hot proud horſe highly diſdaines
To haue his head control'd, but breakes the raines,
Spits forth the ringled bit, and with his houes
Checkes the ſubmiſsiue ground: ſo he that loues,
The more he is reſtrain'd the worſe he fares ;
What is it now, but mad Leander dares ?
O Hero, Hero, thus he cry'd full oft,
And then he got him to a rocke aloft,
Where hauing ſpide her tower, long ſtar'd he on't,
And pray'd the narro w toiling Helleſpont
To part in twaine that he might come and go.
But ſtill the riſing billowes anſwered no ;
With that he ſtript him to the yu'ry skin,
And crying, Loue I come, leapt liuely in :
Whereat the ſaphir viſag'd god grew proud,
And made his capring Triton ſound aloud,
I magining, that Ganmed diſpleaſ'd,
Had left the heauens, therefore on him he ſeaz'd:
Leander ſtriv'd, the waues about him wound,
And puld him to the bottome, where the ground
Was ſtrewd with pearle , and in low corrall growes,
Sweet ſinging Mermayds ſpotted with their loues,
On heapes of heauy gold , and tocke great pleaſure,
To ſpurne in careleſſe ſort the ſhipwracke treaſure :
For here the ſtately azure palace ſtood,

Where Ringly Neptune and his traine abode.
The luſty god imbrac't him, call'd him loue,
And ſwore he neuer ſhould returne to loue :
But when he knew it was not Ganimed,
For vnder water he was almoſt dead,
He heau'd him vp,and looking on his face,
Beat downe the bold waues with his triple mace,
Which mounted vp, intending to haue kiſt him,
And fellin drops like teares, becauſe they miſt him.
Leander being vp, began to ſwim
And looking backe, ſaw Neptune follow him.
Whereat agaſt, the poore ſoule gan to crie,
O let me viſite Hero ere I dye :
The god put Helles bracelet on his arme,
And ſwore the Sea ſhould neuer do him harme.
He clapt his plumpt cheekes, with his treſſes playd,
And ſmiling wantonly, his loue bewrayd ;
He watcht his arms, and as they open'd wide,
At euery ſtroke betwixt them would he ſlide,
And ſteale a kiſſe, and then run out and dance,
And as he turn'd caſt many a luſtfull glance,
And threw him gawdy toyes to pleaſe his eye,
And diue in to the water and there prye
Vpon his breſt, his thighes, and euery lim,
And vp againe, and cloſe beſide him ſwim :
And talke of loue, Leander made reply,
Vou are deceiu'd, I am no woman I.

Thereat ſmil'd Neptune, and then told a tale,
How that a Shepheard ſitting in a vale,
Playd with a boy, ſo faire and kind,
As for his loue, both earth and heauen pin'd,
That of the cooling riuer durſt not drinke,
Leſt water-Nymphs ſhould pul him from the brinke;
And when he ſported in the fragrant lawnes,
Gote-footed Satyrs; and vp-ſtarting Fawnes
Would ſteale him thence,ere halfe his tale was done.
Aye me, Leander cry'd, th'enamored ſunne,
That now ſhould ſhine on Thetis glaſſy bower,
Deſcends vpon my radiant Heroes tower.
O that theſe tardy armes of mine were wings,
And as he ſpake, vpon the waues he ſprings ;
Neptune was angry that he gaue no eare,
And in his heart reuenging malice bare :
He flung at him his mace, but as it went,
He call'd it in, for loue made him repent.
The mace returning backe his owne hand hit,
As meaning to be veng'd for darting it.
When this freſh bleeding wound Leander viewd,
His colour went and came as if he rewd
The griefe which Neptune felt. In gentle breſts,
Relenting thoughts, remorſe and pitty reſts.
And who haue hard hearts, and obdurate minds,
But vicious, hare -brain'd, and illitt'rat hindes ?
The god ſeeing him with pitty to be moued,

Thereon concluded that he was beloued.
(Loue is too full of faith, too credulous,
With folly and falſe hope deluding vs.
Wherefore Leanders fancy to ſurprize,
To the rich Ocean for gifts he flies.
Tis wiſdome to giue much, a gift preuailes,
When deepe perſwading oratorie failes.
By this, Leander being neere the land,
Caſt downe his weery feet, and felt the ſand,
Breathleſſe albeit he were, he reſted not
Till to the ſo'itary tower he got :
And knockt, and call'd, at which celeſtiall noyſe,
The longing heart of Hero much more ioyes, (rings,
Then Nymphes and Shepheards, when the timbrell
Or crooked Dolphin when the Sayler ſings,
She ſtayd not for her robes, but ſtraight aroſe,
And drunke with gladneſſe, to the dore ſhe goes,
Where ſeeing a naked man, ſhe ſcriecht for feare ;
Such ſights as this to tender maids are rare,
And ran into the darke her ſelfe to hide,
Rich Iewels in the darke are ſooneſt ſpide.
(lawne; Vnto her was he led or rather drawne,
By thoſe white lims which ſparkled through the
The neerer that he came, the more ſhe fled,
And ſeeking refuge, ſlipt into her bed,
Whereon Leander ſitting thus began,
Through numming cold, all feeble, faint and wan,

If not for loue , yet loue for pitty ſake,
Me in thy bed and maiden boſome take,
At leaſt, vouchſafe theſe armes ſome little roome,
Who hoping to imbrace thee,cheerely ſwome.
This head was beat with many churliſh billow,
And therefore let it reſt vpon thy pillow.
Herewith affrighted Hero ſhrunke away,
And in her luke-warme place Leander lay,
Whoſe liuely heat like fire from heauen fet,
Would animate groſſe clay, and higher ſet
The drooping thoughts of baſe declining ſoules,
Then drery Mars carowſing Nectar boules.
His hands he caſt vpon her like a ſnare,
She ouercome with ſhame and ſallow feare,
Like chaſt Diana when Acteon ſpide her,
Being ſodainly betray'd, div'd down to hide her,
And as her ſiluer body downeward went,
With both her hands ſhe made the bed a tent,
And in her owne mind thought her ſelfe ſecure,
Orecaſt with dim and darkſome couerture ;
And now ſhe lets him whiſper in her eare,
Flatter, intreat, promiſe, proteſt and ſweare :
Yet euer after as he greedily aſſayd
To touch thoſe dainty, ſhe the Harpey playd,
And euery lim did as a Souldier ſtout,
Defend the fort, and keep the foe-men out.
For though the riſing yu'rie mount he ſcal'd,

Which is with azure circling lines empal'd,
Much like a globe, (a globe may I tearme this,
By which loue ſay les to regions full of blis ?)
Yet there with Syſiphus he toyld in vaine,
Till gentle parly did the truce obtaine.
She trembling ſtroue, this ſtrife of hers (like that
Which made the world) another world begat,
Of vnknowne ioy. Treaſon was in her thought,
And cunningly to yeeld her ſelfe ſhe ſought.
Seeming not woon, yet woon ſhe was at length :
In ſuch warres, women vſe but halfe their ſtrength.
Leander now like Theban Hercules,
Entred the Orchard of Th'eſperides.
Whoſe fruit none rightly can deſcribe but he,
That puls or ſhakes it from the golden tree ;
Wherein Leander on her quiuering breſt,
Breathleſſe, ſpoke ſomething, and ſigh'd out the reſt,
Which ſo preuail'd, as he with ſmall adoe
Inclos'd her in his armes, and kiſt her too,
And euery kiſſe to her was as a charme,
And to Leander as a freſh alarme.
So that the truce was broke, and ſhe alas,
(Poore ſilly mayden) at his mercy was,
Loue is not full of pitty (as men ſay)
But deafe and cruell where he meanes to pray.
Euen as a bird, which in our hands we wring,
Forth plungeth, and oft flutters with her wing.

And now ſhe wiſht this night were neuer done
And ſigh'd to thinke vpon th' approching ſunne,
For much it grieu'd her that the bright day-light,
Should know the pleaſure of this bleſſed night.
And then like Mars and Ericine diſplayed,
Both in each others armes chait'd as they layd.
Againe, ſhe knew not how to frame her looke,
Or ſpeake to him, who in a moment tooke
That which ſo long ſo charily ſhe kept,
And faine by ſtealth away ſhe would haue crept,
And to ſome corner ſecretly haue gone,
Leauing Leander in the bed alone :
But as her naked feete were whipping out,
He on the ſuddaine cling'd her ſo about,
That Meremayd-like vnto the floore ſhe ſlid,
One halfe appear'd, the other halfe was hid.
Thus neere the bed ſhe (bluſhing) ſtood vpright,
And from her countenance behold ye might
A kind of twi-light break, which through the heare,
As from an orient cloud, glimſe here and there.
And round about the chamber this falſe morne,
Brought forth the day before the day was borne.
So Heros ruddy cheeke, Hero betrayd,
And her all naked to his ſight diſplayd.
Whence his admiring eyes more pleaſure tooke,
Than Dis, on heapes of gold fixing his looke,
By this Apollos golden harpe began,

To ſound forth muſicke to the Ocean,
Which watchfull Heſperus no ſooner heard,
But he the day bright-bearing Car prepar'd,
And ran before, as Harbenger of light,
And with his flaring beames mockt ougly night,
Till ſhe o recame with anguiſh, ſhame and rage,
Dang'd downe to hell her loathſome carriage.
